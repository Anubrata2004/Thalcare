ThalCare: An AI-Powered Blood and Transfusion Management System
ThalCare is an innovative full-stack application designed to address the critical challenges in blood supply chains, particularly in regions with high thalassemia rates and limited infrastructure. By leveraging a powerful combination of machine learning and blockchain technology, ThalCare brings order, transparency, and intelligence to medical systems that are often chaotic and prone to error.

Key Features and Technology
Machine Learning: The system uses Random Forest and XGBoost models to predict thalassemia risk in patients, forecast donor availability, and determine the necessity of a blood transfusion. These models were trained on real data and have an accuracy of 80â€“86%.

Blockchain: Every blood donation and transfusion is logged on a secure, tamper-proof blockchain using smart contracts. This feature prevents fraud, eliminates fake donor claims, and ensures a transparent, verifiable record of all transactions.

Web Development: ThalCare features a user-friendly, responsive interface with role-based logins for donors and hospitals. The dashboards provide real-time status updates, patient insights, and predicted alerts.

Benefits and Impact
ThalCare offers significant benefits to all stakeholders:

Hospitals gain instant access to AI recommendations and a verified pool of blood donors.

Donors benefit from a streamlined request process and the ability to track their donation history.

Administrators achieve full visibility into verified transfusions, ensuring accountability and preventing fraud.

By combining predictive analytics, fraud prevention, and a seamless interface, ThalCare provides an end-to-end smart system that can be scaled to rural areas with minimal infrastructure, ultimately improving emergency response times and saving lives.
